## Usage
This folder contains the following files.

-data: This folder contains the .hdf5 data file to which the simulation results are saved.
-mc_main.py: This python script contains the main functions of Monte-Carlo simulation.
-mc_plot.py: This python script contains some functions to plot the results of the simulation saved in the data file.

### Run simulation:

mc_main.py and mc_plot.py are set this way that just running these scripts would reproduce the results from the report.
