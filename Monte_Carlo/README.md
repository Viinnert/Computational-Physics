## Usage

### Run simulation:

Run the two scripts in the main folder by: (The provision of a filename is optional!)

python mc_main.py [data.hdf5]
python mc_plot.py [data.hdf5]

Each recreate the temperature sweep from 1.0 to 4.0 with steps of 0.2 automatically. Additionally data and plots for a single temperature are produced. This temperature can be adjusted by changing the "temp" variable at the end of the "mc_main.py" script.
